    description:
      "The National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression was  founded in 1973 in Chicago, Illinois to mount organized action against unjust treatment of individuals because of race or political beliefs. Its founding grew out of the struggle to free Angela Davis from a racist  frame-up on murder charges surrounding the aborted attempt by Jonathan  Jackson to free his brother, George Jackson and the Soledad Brothers in 1970.  \n\nThe organization and its regional chapters have the following goals:  \n\n### Establish Civilian Control of Police\nFrom its inception the NAARPR has campaigned against police crimes committed primarily against the poor and people of color. The Alliance initiated a campaign to Stop Police Crimes. Victims of those crimes and their families are actively involved. The Alliance is organizing for passage of legislation to establish an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council that holds police officers accountable for crimes such as assault, murder, torture, and racial profiling.  \n\n### Free Political Prisoners and the Innocent\nOver the years the NAARPR has successfully campaigned for the release of many persons falsely charged and sentenced to death or to long prison terms.  We, in alliance with mass progressive organizations, led the struggle for freedom of the Wilmington Ten, Tchula Mississippi Mayor Eddie Carthan, Delbert Tibbs, and many others.  We campaign to end the unjust imprisonment of Leonard Peltier, and leaders of the Black Panther Party who remain in prison.\n\n### Stop all Police Torture of Suspects\nChicago police have tortured hundreds of Black and Latino men.  We are struggling for hearings and new trials for those who remain incarcerated.   We have investigated many of their cases.  We are convinced they are innocent and were convicted only by confessions made under torture.  We were part of the struggle for the release of Nicole Harris, a young Chicago mother coerced to confess to killing her own young child. We are also struggling for freedom for Derrick Searcy, James Harris, Michael Harris, Clayborn Smith, Charles Solo Harris and a host of others.\n\n### Abolish the Death Penalty\nThe U.S.A. has more people on death row than any other country in the world. The NAARPR works with other organizations to end the death penalty. The abolition of the death penalty in Illinois has helped thrust this issue on the national agenda, resulting in the introduction of several National Death Penalty Moratorium bills in Congress.  Fifteen states have abolished capital punishment.\n\nFor a full list of goals, [please visit the NAARPR website](https://naarpr.org/about/).\n\n \n",

The Alliance initiated a campaign to Stop Police Crimes. Victims of those crimes and their families are actively involved. The Alliance is organizing for passage of legislation to establish an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council that holds police officers accountable for crimes such as assault, murder, torture, and racial profiling.  \n\n### Free Political Prisoners and the Innocent\nOver the years the NAARPR has successfully campaigned for the release of many persons falsely charged and sentenced to death or to long prison terms.  We, in alliance with mass progressive organizations, led the struggle for freedom of the Wilmington Ten, Tchula Mississippi Mayor Eddie Carthan, Delbert Tibbs, and many others.  We campaign to end the unjust imprisonment of Leonard Peltier, and leaders of the Black Panther Party who remain in prison.\n\n### Stop all Police Torture of Suspects\nChicago police have tortured hundreds of Black and Latino men.  We are struggling for hearings and new trials for those who remain incarcerated.   We have investigated many of their cases.  We are convinced they are innocent and were convicted only by confessions made under torture.

Organizers began tabling and talking to folks who lived in the neighborhood on what was bothering them and issues they were facing. By offering a cup of coffee, NYCAP members talked at length with people about policing in the neighboorhood, the collaboration between Lincoln Hospital and the NYPD, and resources were scarce for the needs that mattered. In November of that year, members of NYCAP headed to Chicago for the refounding of the National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and learned about the campaign for a Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC). They brought the CPAC campaign back to the Bronx where it garnered favorable support, and NYCAP has been working on that campaign since.\n\n### Our Justice Platform\n\n- Build community control of the police! Create a Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC).\n- Stop the racist police killings of Black and Brown people. Convict and jail killer cops now!\n- End all evictions by law enforcement. Housing is a human right!\n- Stop all deportations. Legalization for all!\n- Defund the police and the prison system. We demand resources for healthcare, jobs, and education, not for police and prisons.\n- Fully support families and communities affected by the pandemic by canceling all back rent, canceling all medical bills, and dropping charges related to social distancing violations, which have mostly targeted Black and Latinx communities.\n- Release all political prisoners now. Free them all!\n- We condemn all violence against LGBTQIA+ people. We need accessible healthcare for all, not more police harassment.\n- End all U.S. wars! That funding should go to our communities, not to military aggression.\n\n\n\n\n",

The council would be made up of people who have ZERO ties to law enforcement, are elected by the community in their police district, and are long-term organizers with a track record of fighting for marginalized communities.\n\nWe join the ranks of other organizations across the US who are demanding the formation of CPACs in their own cities. We are affiliated with [NAARPR](https://www.joinalocal.org/organization/naarpr-6605f3f7dfec5b9129efaedb), the National Alliance Against Racism and Political Repression, who oversees a networks of organizations demanding the same thing.

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations. Genuine reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism.\n\n## Only a socialist planned economy can combat the climate crisis\n\nFor an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. For public ownership and control over mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits.\n\n## Nationalize the major banks and monopolies\n\nBreak with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market—expropriate the key levers of the economy. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media. Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all. All nationalized companies to be run under democratic workers’ control and management, integrated into a socialist plan of production to meet the needs of society.\n\n## Socialist internationalism and world revolution\n\nNo to imperialist intervention anywhere in the world. For international economic cooperation based on solidarity and the interests of the workers of the world, not a handful of multinationals. Abolish all capitalist trade and bankers’ agreements and write off the debts imposed by imperialism. Slash the military budget and invest in social needs. Unite with Canadian and Latin American workers in a Socialist Federation of the Americas as part of a World Socialist Federation.",

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation.

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations. Genuine reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism.\n\n## Only a socialist planned economy can combat the climate crisis\n\nFor an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. For public ownership and control over mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits.\n\n## Nationalize the major banks and monopolies\n\nBreak with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market—expropriate the key levers of the economy. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media. Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all. All nationalized companies to be run under democratic workers’ control and management, integrated into a socialist plan of production to meet the needs of society.\n\n## Socialist internationalism and world revolution\n\nNo to imperialist intervention anywhere in the world. For international economic cooperation based on solidarity and the interests of the workers of the world, not a handful of multinationals. Abolish all capitalist trade and bankers’ agreements and write off the debts imposed by imperialism. Slash the military budget and invest in social needs. Unite with Canadian and Latin American workers in a Socialist Federation of the Americas as part of a World Socialist Federation.",

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations.

All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations. Genuine reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism.\n\n## Only a socialist planned economy can combat the climate crisis\n\nFor an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. For public ownership and control over mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits.\n\n## Nationalize the major banks and monopolies\n\nBreak with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market—expropriate the key levers of the economy. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media. Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all. All nationalized companies to be run under democratic workers’ control and management, integrated into a socialist plan of production to meet the needs of society.\n\n## Socialist internationalism and world revolution\n\nNo to imperialist intervention anywhere in the world. For international economic cooperation based on solidarity and the interests of the workers of the world, not a handful of multinationals. Abolish all capitalist trade and bankers’ agreements and write off the debts imposed by imperialism. Slash the military budget and invest in social needs. Unite with Canadian and Latin American workers in a Socialist Federation of the Americas as part of a World Socialist Federation.",

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations. Genuine reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism.\n\n## Only a socialist planned economy can combat the climate crisis\n\nFor an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. For public ownership and control over mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits.\n\n## Nationalize the major banks and monopolies\n\nBreak with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market—expropriate the key levers of the economy. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media. Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all.

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan.

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude. Full reproductive rights up to and including abortion.\n\n## An injury to one is an injury to all—fight racism with class struggle\n\nUnite the working class against all forms of division! Mobilize the labor movement to combat sexism, racism, police terror, and mass incarceration. Abolish the death penalty and release all political prisoners. For genuine freedom of assembly and expression—defend civil rights and political liberties. No to walls, deportation centers, and repression at the border. End all racist immigration and asylum controls. For immediate and unconditional legalization: full rights and amnesty for undocumented workers and their families. For family reunification and an immediate end to raids and deportations. Recognize the tribal sovereignty of American Indian Nations. Genuine reparations for centuries of slavery, colonialism, exploitation, and oppression can only be achieved by expropriating the capitalists and building socialism.\n\n## Only a socialist planned economy can combat the climate crisis\n\nFor an immediate transition to clean energy—retool the economy to ensure a safe and healthy habitat for generations to come. Massively fund research to develop mitigation strategies and new production techniques. Paid retraining and guaranteed employment for displaced workers with no reduction in wages or benefits. For public ownership and control over mining, logging, transport, oil, gas, and other energy and natural resources. Protect small farmers and agricultural workers’ job security. For a socialized plan of production for agriculture—nationalize the food distribution and agrochemical giants that endanger public health and nutrition in the pursuit of profits.\n\n## Nationalize the major banks and monopolies\n\nBreak with the irrational chaos of the capitalist free market—expropriate the key levers of the economy. No to austerity and privatization—make the billionaires pay for the crisis of their system! Nationalize the means of communication and democratize access to the media. Consolidate the banking sector into a unified, publicly owned and administered entity to protect workers’ savings and guarantee affordable loans to all. All nationalized companies to be run under democratic workers’ control and management, integrated into a socialist plan of production to meet the needs of society.\n\n## Socialist internationalism and world revolution\n\nNo to imperialist intervention anywhere in the world. For international economic cooperation based on solidarity and the interests of the workers of the world, not a handful of multinationals. Abolish all capitalist trade and bankers’ agreements and write off the debts imposed by imperialism. Slash the military budget and invest in social needs. Unite with Canadian and Latin American workers in a Socialist Federation of the Americas as part of a World Socialist Federation.",

      "The Revolutionary Communists of America is building a communist party that aims to end capitalism and create a world where workers have the power to solve the pressing issues of our society today, such as poverty, racism, misogyny, and violence. \n\nWe are also known as the American wing of the IMT, or the International Marxist Tendency. \n\n# Our Program\n\n## Build a mass communist party!\n\nFor class independence—down with the Democrats and Republicans! Workers need a communist party to fight the capitalist class, establish a workers’ government, and implement a revolutionary program. The IMT is organizing workers and youth to build the foundations of that party.\n\n## Rebuild the labor movement through militant class struggle\n\nCommunists built the American labor movement and formed the backbone of industrial unionism. Armed with a class-struggle program and strategy, a mass communist party can build a fighting labor movement. Repeal all antiunion laws—all workers should have the right to strike and join a union. Organize the unorganized! No to multi-tier contracts, concessions, and give-backs. All union officials to be regularly elected by the membership with the right of immediate recall, receiving no more than the average wage of a skilled worker.\n\n## End unemployment—quality jobs for all\n\nFull-time jobs with benefits or a place in education for all. For a twenty-hour workweek with no loss in pay and a national minimum wage of $1,250 per week. Wages to be tied to inflation through periodic cost of living adjustments. For union control over hiring and firing and the establishment of job training and hiring halls in areas with high unemployment. Unemployment and Social Security benefits to be paid at full wages with voluntary retirement at age 55. For a massive program of useful public works to create millions of quality union jobs to rebuild and expand public infrastructure, transportation, and housing.\n\n## Quality, affordable housing for all\n\nEnd the capitalist housing market, which leads to overcrowding, gentrification, and homelessness. Rent for all housing to be fixed at not more than 10% of wages, as part of a voluntary, socialized plan. Nationalize foreclosed and vacant homes, to be allocated to those in need under democratic public control. For an immediate and indefinite moratorium on evictions, with residents of foreclosed properties allowed to stay in their homes.\n\n## Universal, quality health care\n\nFor a socialized health care system free at the point of service. Nationalize the health insurance, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical industries, the hospital networks and related clinics, and integrate them into a unified, democratically administered public health provider. Free scientific research from the profit motive and ensure universal access to the latest medical technologies, treatments, and discoveries. Expand accessibility to accommodate those with disabilities and massively fund research to combat epidemics and disease.\n\n## Quality, lifelong education for all\n\nFully fund and expand public schools, colleges, and universities. Nationalize the private universities and colleges and merge them into a unified public education system. Abolish tuition and fees and cancel student debt. Provide students with at least $1,250 per week through living grants and paid internships. No to means testing, vouchers, charter schools, privatization, and corporate influence in the classroom.\n\n## Fight oppression in all its forms—equal rights for all\n\nNo to discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation. Equal pay for work of equal value. Full paid leave for expectant mothers after the first trimester and fully paid parental leave for up to two years after birth or adoption. For free, full-time, childcare facilities and after-school programs. For affordable public laundry services and restaurants serving healthy food to help free working women from domestic servitude.

      "[The Palestinian Rights Committee](https://prcalbany.com/history-of-the-prc) (PRC) was formed during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon and after the massacre of Palestinians at Sabra and Shatila in Beirut. Several Palestinians, Palestinian-Americans, and others met and began holding a vigil each September at the Federal Building (near the Palace Theater) in Albany on the anniversary of the massacre.\n\nUp until about 2000, the PRC was known as the Capital District Committee for Palestinian Rights. During the more than forty years of the CDCPR/PRC, Palestinians and Jews have been active members. The CDCPR/PRC has always rejected any accomodation with anti semitism. About fifteen years ago, the PRC joined the Upper Hudson Peace Action (UHPA), the local affiliate of a national peace group, to demonstrate to all that the PRC is in fact a peace group.\n\nThe CDCPR initially operated informally. By 1986, a larger nucleus had formed, a contact list created, and other events were held. During the First Intifadah, the CDCPR held annual dinners at which a hundred people enjoyed excellent Palestinian foods and comradery, a newsletter was published and mailed several times annually, CDCPR members attended the annual ADC conferences in Washington, DC and CDCPR members began publishing letters to the editor to local newspapers. The Times Union printed almost none, but the Schenectady Daily Gazette and Troy Times Record printed many. CDCPR began meeting at the Social Justice Center in Albany, bringing speakers to the region, and occasionally counter demonstrating at Zionist events.\n\nThe PRC hosts and promotes events in the Capital Region ranging from marches and picketing to conferences and movie nights. They frequently collaborate with the Albany chapters of Jewish Voices for Peace, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Codepink, etc. ",

This moment in history calls for bold leaders who are prepared to stand on the truth and lead through action. BAMN exists to develop the conscious political method needed to turn our struggles into fights that can win learning both from the successes and mistakes of our own struggles, and from the most successful leaders of mass movements like Martin Luther King and Frederick Douglass.  \n\nOur movement is integrated and international, and we are fighting for fundamental equality and freedom for all of humanity, for a new kind of society. We are fighting to put the oppressed in power. Our movement fights for open borders, for a definition of citizenship that says if you live here, work here, go to school here, contribute to this society, you are a citizen and should have full citizenship rights. We are not a ‘single issue’ campaign because the struggles are not separate, and we can’t win if we separate them. If you agree with the views and demands in this leaflet, BAMN is for you.

We will fight to preserve, expand, and improve the public transportation system in Seattle and beyond, so that every human being has access to safe, affordable, and reliable public transit.\n\nOur Principles:\n\n1. We believe that every human being has a right to safe, reliable, affordable, and accessible public transit.\n\n2. We recognize that, for the future of humanity and of the planet, we must move beyond the car- and fossil fuel-based economy.\n\n3.

We want high-capacity rapid transit, including buses and rail – but not at the cost of cutting off those who need public transit the most.\n\n5. We believe that public transit must be paid for by corporations and the wealthiest section of the population, not by further squeezing poor and working people.\n\n6. We are an organization primarily of poor and working people who depend on public transit; we will achieve our aims by first of all organizing and mobilizing this disenfranchised and growing section of the population.\n\n7. We are a grassroots, participatory, and democratic organization; we believe that the decisions that affect the lives of poor and working people should be made by those people, and not by bureaucrats or corporate elites.\n\n8. We recognize that in order to achieve our transit aims, poor and working people must build up social power, economic power, and political power; we will not hesitate to fight in any of these spheres, as needed for the advancement of our cause.\n\n9. We are independent of all political parties, governments, unions, businesses, and non-profits; however, we may choose to work with any of these in coalition.\n\n10.
